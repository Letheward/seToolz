# [Set Tools for NoCS](https://letheward.github.io/seToolz/)

## How To Use

You can enter set by:
- Type in "Enter Set"
- Click Clock Diagram

Click "Play" to play.
If no speed is given, it will play at speed `1`.  
set to `4` for reasonably fast speed.  
(you can go crazy with this)

"To Root" will set your root to first note in the set.

"Set Root To" will set your root at given Index. (start on 0)  
You can set Index to `1` and click "Set Root To" multiple times to calculating modes of a scale.

"Jump By" will rearrange set by given Interval (in integer notation).  
Set Interval to `2` for get tertian representation of a scale.

## Status

Still really early. This is enough for my personal use, so I will update only when I feel like it.

PRs and issues are welcome, though.
